# Variance Metric Appender

## Description
A tool to append metrics from previously generated data to a list of genes.

## Usage
Open the main script `run_VMM.sh` to start.

## Requirements
This tool requires the final output file `chrALL_grouped_data_with_GO_terms.csv` which can be generated from scripts in the [Variance Model](https://github.com/bryantcao/variance-model) repository (currently private).

Ensure that `chrALL_grouped_data_with_GO_terms.csv` is in the `required` directory before running.

The input file should be a table with __Gene_list__ as the header and with gene symbols separated by line breaks below the header.
